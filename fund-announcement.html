                    We are thrilled to announce the launch of Layout Ventures, backing first institutional rounds for companies selling into healthcare.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the first time, technology capabilities are genuinely aligned with what patients, providers, payers, and researchers actually need. This convergence is creating unprecedented opportunities for companies - clinical or non-clinical - to build alongside the healthcare ecosystem. Those that do can establish defensible advantages in distribution, proprietary data, and regulatory compliance that compound over time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because of this, to put it simply, we back any innovative technology that makes healthcare cheaper, better, faster, or more accessible—whether it's clinical or behind the scenes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As one of the earliest employees at Flatiron Health, investors in Apella, board members at SafeRide Health, and founding advisors at Ostro, I've had the unique privilege of riding along as these companies grew and reshaped how care is coordinated, delivered and paid for. And thanks to these extraordinary founders that I've worked with, Layout has a massive network of trusted stakeholders across healthcare: systems, payers, life science, and capital. These are folks who help unlock the biggest missions impacting healthcare, at the earliest stages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To our LPs who believed in this vision from the start, the founders who have trusted us and the broader healthcare community that continues to open doors to the incredible companies we back: Thank you.
                </p>

                <p class="announcement-closing">
                    It's never too early for new founders to see how our abilities, ambitions, powers, connections and vision are way bigger than our check size. (Just ask any of our existing founders.) Are you building something with the power to transform the healthcare ecosystem? If so, please get in touch!
