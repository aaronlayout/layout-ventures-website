                    We are thrilled to announce the launch of Layout Ventures, backing Founders who unlock the biggest missions impacting healthcare, at the earliest stages.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We are at a unique time where technology capabilities are genuinely aligned with what patients, providers, payers, life science and researchers actually need. This convergence is creating unprecedented opportunities for companies - clinical or non-clinical - to build alongside the healthcare ecosystem. Those that do can establish defensible advantages in distribution, proprietary data, and regulatory compliance that compound over time and can be expanded to many industries.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Because of this, to put it simply, we back any innovative technology that makes healthcare cheaper, better, faster, or more accessible—whether it's clinical or behind the scenes.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I’ve had the unique privilege of riding along as an early partner and operator to so many early stage companies that grew and reshaped how care is coordinated, delivered and paid for. And thanks to these extraordinary founders, colleagues and partners that I’ve worked with, Layout has a massive network of trusted stakeholders across healthcare (systems, payers, life science, and capital), that accelerate early sales and partnerships.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    It's never too early for new founders to see how our abilities, ambitions, powers, connections and vision are way bigger than our check size. If you are building something with the power to transform the healthcare ecosystem (and go beyond) - please get in touch!
